# Image Detection for Research

This code performs a simple detection of shapes in a set of images using OpenCV.<br>
The specific application was performing detection of blood vessels in JPEG images.

### Quickstart Usage
- Ensure requirements are installed
- Create a folder called images in the same folder as the code
- Place all the images in that folder
- Open a command line/terminal/PowerShell window to the location of the folder with the code (cd = change directory)
- Type `python ./bulk_detection.py`
- See `results.csv` for results

### Requirements
Python 3.x<br>
OpenCV<br>
Pandas<br>
numpy (for plots in sample_detection.py)
