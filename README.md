# Image Detection for Research

This code performs a simple detection of shapes in a set of images using OpenCV.
This code is on GitHub for sharing with a researcher.

### Quickstart Usage
- Ensure requirements are installed
- Create a folder called images in the same folder as the code
- Place all the images in that folder
- Open a command line/terminal/PowerShell window to the location of the folder with the code (cd = change directory)
- Type `python ./bulk_detection.py`

### Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
numpy (for plots in sample_detection.py only)
